Sequence features allow a simple way to represent and access the 
variety of genomic features.

It models genomic features in terms of their position relative to 
a reference genome and provides access patterns for gene, exon, 
transcipt, variant, and other feature types from the Sequence 
Ontology (http://www.sequenceontology.org).
