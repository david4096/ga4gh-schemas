        This allows the mining of allele-specific annotations on a VariantSet by
        either a region or by a set of genomic features. Where a region is supplied
        annotation of all alleles vs all features in the region is returned. Where
        a set of features is supplied, only annotations against these features
        (matching on featuretype and id) are returned and other overlapping
        features are ignored.

        `variantannotationsets/search` returns information on the input to the
        annotation. This will be a VariantSet and the reference data and software
        versions used in calculating the annotation. It is essential this
        information is exhaustive.

        `POST /variantannotations/search` must accept a JSON version of
        `SearchVariantAnnotationsRequest` as the post body and will return a JSON

      genotype:

          other value is a 1-based index into the alternate alleles of the associated
          `Variant`.

          If a variant had a referenceBases field of "T", an alternateBases
          value of ["A", "C"], and the genotype was [2, 1], that would mean the call
          represented the heterozygous value "CA" for this variant. If the genotype
          was instead [0, 1] the represented value would be "TA". Ordering of the
          genotype values is important if the phaseset field is present.
          Missing genotype genotypes may be indicated using the "dot annotation" [".", "."],

      This request maps to the body of `POST /featurephenotypeassociations/search` as JSON.

      The goal here is to allow users to query using one or more of
      Genotype, Phenotype, Environment, and Evidence.

      A query using one of the above items is to mean, by default,
      that the remainder of the query is as a "wildcard", such
      that all matches to just that query term would come back.
      Combinations of the above are to act like AND rather than OR.

      The "genotype" part of the query methods can be one or more
      genomic features.  Associations can be made at many
      levels of granularity (from whole genotypes down to individual
      SNVs), but users may use these methods with partial or
      inexact information.  Therefore, the query methods must be
      able to support query of some or all of the associated features.
      Furthermore, use of the relationships between genomic features
      means that when querying for a gene, any variants to that
      gene are also returned.  For example, a query with
      BRCA2 would mean that in addition to any direct associations
      to the BRCA2, all associations to sequence variants of BRCA2 would also
      be returned.  Similarly, queries with OntologyTerms should perform
      the subclass closure.

      Each query can be made against a string, an array of external
      identifers (such as for gene or SNP ids), ontology term ids, or
      full feature/phenotype/evidence objects.

      `Struct` represents a structured data value, consisting of fields
      which map to dynamically typed values. In some languages, `Struct`
      might be supported by a native representation. For example, in
      scripting languages like JS a struct is represented as an
      object. The details of that representation are described together
      with the proto support for the language.

      The JSON representation for `Struct` is JSON object.

      `Value` represents a dynamically typed value which can be either
      null, a number, a string, a boolean, a recursive struct value, or a
      list of values. A producer of value is expected to set one of that
      variants, absence of any variant indicates an error.

      The JSON representation for `Value` is JSON value.
